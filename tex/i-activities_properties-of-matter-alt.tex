%All matter is made up of particles. These particles are in constant motion which increases with their temperature. Depending on temperature, matter may exist in three states: \emph{solid}, \emph{liquid} or \emph{gas}.

\item[Theory:]{When students or objects are close together, they represent particles in the \emph{solid} state. As they move apart and past each other they represent particles in the \emph{liquid} state. Fast and randomly moving pupils or objects represent particles in the \emph{gaseous} state.}

%\item[Hazards:]{}
\item[Questions:]{Which activity corresponds to which state of matter?}
%\item[Observations:]{}
\item[Theory:]{The movement of particles in solids is small and hence they are in fixed order. In liquids the particles move past each other and have lost the stiff order. In gases they move very fast and randomly, losing all order.}

%\item[Hazards:]{}
%\item[Questions:]{}
%\item[Observations:]{}
\item[Theory:]{(a) Water spreads to form a patch on the first glass surface because \emph{adhesive forces}
attract water molecules to the glass surface.

between glass and water are large.}

\item[Procedure:]{Fill the bottle with water and allow it to flow through the holes at the bottom. Use your thumb and forefinger to pinch the streams together to form a single stream. Pass your hand over the holes and all five will appear again.}
%\item[Hazards:]{}
%\item[Questions:]{}
%\item[Observations:]{}
\item[Theory:]{Water has a tendency to cling to itself due to its surface tension and cohesion. As you bring the streams together, you allow the water to stick to itself forming a single stream. Passing your hand in front again stops the flow of water and allows it to start again in five streams.}
