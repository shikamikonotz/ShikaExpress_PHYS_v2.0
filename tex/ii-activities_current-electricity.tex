%Conductors and Insulators

%\subsection{Conductor Switch Test}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{Preparation Time: 5 minutes}
%\item{Materials: Two or three batteries, wires, bulb, switch, various materials to test (spoon, rubber strip, stick, mchelewaji, etc.)}
%\item{Procedure: Set up the circuit so that the wires, switch, and bulb are connected to the batteries in series. Close the switch to show that the bulb lights when current is passing. Open the switch. Place each material in turn across the switch, closing the circuit. Any materials that successfully close the circuit and the bulb lights can be considered conductors, and any materials that fail to close the circuit and do not light the bulb are insulators or poor conductors.}
%\item{Theory: Conductors will freely allow electric current to pass, so when a conductor is used to close the switch, the circuit is complete and current will pass, lighting the bulb. Insulators, however, do not permit current to flow, so the circuit will still be broken despite the switch being ‘closed’ with the insulator.}
%\end{itemize}


\subsection{Conductors and Insulators}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To distinguish between conductors and insulators} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
A nail, small piece of a bucket lid, aluminium foil from an empty cigarette packet, cotton thread, connecting wires, two dry cell, light bulb


\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Connect a bulb, dry cell, and a nail in a series using the connecting wire. Observe the effects.} 
\item{Replace the nail with aluminium foil, a cotton thread, and a small piece of a bucket cap, one after the other. Observe the effects.} 
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
The bulb lights when it is connected with a nail and aluminium foil, indicating that there is a flow of current. The bulb does not light when it is connected with a cotton thread and a small piece of a bucket lid, indicating that a current does not flow. A nail and aluminium foil are conductors of electricity while a piece of a cotton thread and a piece of bucket cap are insulators --- they do not conduct electricity.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What is a conductor?}
\item{Give four examples of (a) conductors (b) insulators.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Metals like copper, aluminium, iron are used for connecting electric current. When electrons flow through the metal they reach the bulb and so it lights up. Such metals are called Conductors. On the other hand, plastics, wood, cotton threads are not used because electrons are not free flow through them so the bulb will not light. Such materials are called insulators.

\subsection{Finding Electric Circuit Components}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To identify various components used in electric circuits} 
\item{To find circuit components locally} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
All of the electrical components studied in secondary school are common devices. These include resistors, capacitors, wires, motors, rheostats, switches, diodes, transistors, transformers, speakers, inductors, bulbs, etc. These components are common enough that they can be found in varying numbers and combinations in any electrical device. 

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Broken radio, broken car stereo, broken computer, broken phone charger, broken disc drive, etc., pliers, screw driver, soldering iron (\textit{optional})

\subsubsection*{Hazards and Safety}
\begin{itemize}
\item{If you are using a soldering iron, be careful not to touch it or touch someone else with it. It can very quickly cause second degree burns.} 
\item{After breaking and removing components, dispose of any sharp pieces.} 
\item{NEVER open a component which is connected to an electrical source!} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Ask people to bring any broken electrical devices.} 
\item{Go to a radio repair shop in town to find any broken or old components.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Open any electrical device.} 
\item{Identify all of the components visible inside the device.} 
\item{Remove as many components as possible from the devices and place them in a container. Pliers can be used to retrieve most things, but sometimes a soldering iron will be necessary to melt the flux holding some components into their boards.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
Circuit components can be found almost anywhere and can be used to perform many activities.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all useful components in a container and store for later use.} 
\item{Dispose of any unused pieces.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What components were you able to retrieve, and from what devices?}
\item{What components were you not able to retrieve, and where might you find them?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
This should be an ongoing activity for any school. Circuit components are always needed as they are easily destroyed in the laboratory. Keep looking for more things to take apart. 


%\subsection{Light Bulb in a Jar}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{Preparation Time: half hour}
%\item{Materials: Glass jar with lid, glue, wires, power source, small length of thin iron wire}
%\item{Procedure: Poke two holes in the jar lid and pass a wire through each about half way into the jar. Connect the wire ends inside the jar with the length of iron wire and seal the wires into the lid with glue. Close the lid and connect the wires to the power source. If enough current is passing, the iron wire will light up, creating a ‘light bulb’ for a short time until the wire burns out.}
%\end{itemize}


\subsection{Creating a Light Bulb}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To observe the luminosity effect of current in a thin wire}
\item{To understand the mode of action of a light bulb}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
When electricity pass through a wire, resistance converts electrical energy into heat energy. This heat energy causes an increase in the temperature of the wire. If the wire gets hot enough, it will release energy as radiation visible light, red at lower temperatures to yellow to white at very hot temperatures. The effect, however, causes the wire to degrade and eventually the wire is not strong enough to pass current.  When a lot of electrical energy is converted into light energy, the effect is that of a light bulb, which consists of a single, thin wire in a glass bulb.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Glass jar with lid, glue, wires, power source, small length of thin iron wire, nail

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Use the nail to poke two holes in the jar lid.}
\item{Pass a wire through each hole about half way into the jar.}
\item{Connect the wires inside the jar with the length of iron wire.}
\item{Seal the wires into the lid with glue.}
\item{Close the lid on the jar.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Connect the wires outside the jar to the power source.}
\item{Observe the effect inside the jar.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
If enough current is passing, the iron wire will light up, creating a light bulb for a short time until the
wire burns out.  

\subsubsection*{Cleanup Procedure}
Disconnect all wires and return all materials to their proper places.

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Why does the wire produce light?}
\item{Why do bulbs eventually stop working?}
\item{Mention some other materials which produce light when heated.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
You may need to try different types of wire for the bulb.  If iron wire is not available or does not work, try other types.  It should be very thin and have high resistance in order to work.

\subsection{Measuring Emf of a Cell}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To identify the terminals of a cell} 
\item{To use a voltmeter or multimeter in parallel} 
\item{To measure the electromotive force of a single cell or battery} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
Electromotic force (Emf) --- also called voltage or potential difference --- is the force from a cell or battery to move electric current through a circuit. A voltmeter reads the difference in voltage between two points in a circuit. If the difference in voltage is measured across a cell, the amount of voltage used in the entire circuit, from the positive terminal of the cell to the negative terminal, is being measured. This is the same as measuring the amount of voltage supplied by a cell, or the Emf. 

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Working dry cells, speaker wire / connecting wire, multimeter or voltmeter



\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Set the multimeter to the DCV (direct current voltage) setting.} 
\item{Connect the terminals of the multimeter to the terminals of the battery so that the multimeter displays a voltage level.} 
\item{Adjust the voltage magnitude on the multimeter until the voltage displayed is a clear, readable value.} 
\item{Connect two batteries in series and measure the total Emf.}
\item{Connect two batteries in parallel and measure the total Emf.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusions}
If a new battery is being used, the voltmeter should display the full Emf of a cell, which is 1.5~V. If an older battery is being used, the Emf may show a slightly lower value. Students will see that the voltage (Emf) measured across a single cell shows all of the force of the cell without losing any through resistors. Also, the Emf of batteries in series is more than that of batteries in parallel.

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Turn off the multimeter.} 
\item{Collect all the used materials, storing items that will be used later.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What causes the force of the cell?}
\item{What is moving through the circuit?}
\item{Why is a voltmeter connected in parallel across a cell in order to measure Emf?}
\item{What is the difference between the Emf of batteries in series and parallel?}
\item{How would you calculate the Emf of batteries in series? In parallel?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Electromotive force (Emf) is a kind of voltage. The other kind of voltage is Potential Difference and is used to measure the voltage difference across a resistor. Emf is always the same for a battery; it does not depend on the circuit it is connected to. Connecting batteries in series simply adds the forces of all the batteries together. Connecting batteries in parallel provides the same voltage as the battery with the largest voltage.
