\chapter{Checking Voltmeters and Ammeters/Galvanometers}
Needed: Meters to check, a couple of wires, some resistors and a fresh battery.  
Important note: There is a wrong way to hook up the meter. The needle will
try to detect down because negative and positive are swapped. If the reading
is zero, make sure that you try the opposite connection to be sure.  
\section{Voltmeters}
Hook up the voltmeter across the battery. The battery is probably 1.5~V, but
do not worry if you see 1.1, 1.2, even if using a brand new battery. Try not to
use a battery that reads much below 1~V on several different meters.  
\subsection{Unusable Voltmeters}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Totally dead, no detection of the needle}
\item{Voltage reading jumps excessively. Ensure that the connections are solid
and test again.}
\item{Measured voltage is totally wrong, not close to 1.5~V}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Usable Voltmeters}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Read a voltage close to 1.5}
\item{If the voltage if not 1.5 exactly, the voltmeter is probably working and the battery is just old a bit.}  
\end{itemize}

\section{Ammeters}
Hook up the ammeter in series with a resistor. Because you do not necessarily
know the condition of the ammeter before testing, be sure to have several different
resistors on hand. An ammeter may appear not to work if resistance is
too high or too low. Start testing different ammeters.  
\subsection{Unusable Ammeters}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Totally dead, no detection of the needle}
\item{Current reading jumps excessively (but check connections)}
\item{Totally wrong, reads much different from other ammeters}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Usable Ammeters}
Reads a current similar to other ammeters. \\
Hard to say exactly what current, 
but feel free to calculate based on your resistor using V=IR, although do not
forget that there is some internal resistance r of battery, so V = I(R + r). \\
The resistance of the resistor is usually coded on the resistor in a series in stripes -
see the instructions under \nameref{sec:resistors} in the \nameref{cha:local-materials} section.  \\
Tip: You can hold the wires onto the battery with your fingers; the current
is far too low to cause a shock.  \\
Other: Now that you have tested to see if your voltmeters and ammeters
work, you can feel free to check all of them for accuracy, by calculating expected
values and comparing between meters. Most practicals will still work alright
with somewhat accurate meters.
