\chapter*{About This Book}

\emph{Shika na Mikono} is a training manual for U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Tanzania. Many of these Volunteers work in schools without laboratories and all are new to the details of the Tanzanian syllabus. This manual is prepared to help them teach science more effectively.

Just before the rains returned at the end of 2009, 
Peace Corps Tanzania recruited Leigh Carroll and I 
to conduct a training on laboratory methods 
for the new cohort of education Volunteers. 
We decided to write a hand-out for our presentation, 
summarizing ``everything that Volunteers needed to know about the lab.'' 
We quickly realized that this was a much larger undertaking 
than we could manage on our own 
and began recruiting other Peace Corps Volunteers. 
Thus the \emph{Shika na Mikono} project was born.

As the first edition came together, several themes emerged. 
We believe that hands-on activities are essential for learning science. 
We believe that the use of local and low cost materials 
can enable any school to do these activities. 
Finally, we believe that for hands-on science to be successful, 
it must be safe. 
These three ideas -- interactive learning, equity, and safety -- 
remain the core of the \emph{Shika} vision.

Given the enthusiastic response to the first edition 
and the significant work the project had done in the past year, 
we decided to produce a second edition, 
this one for the 2010 Peace Corps Pre-Service Training. 
Once again, many people contributed to this effort, 
most especially PCVs Michael Rush, Kristen Grauer-Gray, and Peter McDonough 
-- without their excellent ideas and passionate hard work, 
this book would not exist.

The third edition of \emph{Shika na Mikono} for Tanzania included additional content created by
PCVs Jessi Bond, Carolyn Rhodebeck, and Dylan Masters. Peter McDonough 
also made substantial additions and revision. 
PCV Dave Berg provided the inspiration, instruction, 
and much of the labor to import the manual into \LaTeX.

Many of the ideas for locally available materials 
come from or were inspired by the Source Books 
published by the Mzumbe Book Project, Morogoro, Tanzania. 
Several other ideas for locally available materials 
were developed at Bihawana Secondary by Mwl. Mohamed Mwijuma. 
PCVs Peter Finin and Gregor Passolt wrote 
a book on physics demonstrations in 2008 
that has been incorporated wholesale 
into the activities portion of this manual. 
My own knowledge of the laboratory was greatly increased 
by a brilliant if ancient book found on the shelves of Bihawana Secondary -- 
the cover and title pages with the title have long since been lost, 
but the preface sites G.P.Rendle, M.D.W. Vokins and P.M.H. Davis as authors, 
and 1967 as the date of publication.

We are all grateful to our schools 
for giving us the opportunity to work in such supportive environments, 
the freedom to explore these ideas, 
and the time to document them. 
We have certainly benefited from the wisdom 
and creativity of many other teachers, 
both in this country and in America. 
Many of us working without reliable electricity 
or internet connections benefited enormously 
from the hospitality of the numerous families 
who sheltered us in town. 
We are all grateful to Peace Corps Tanzania for supporting our work, 
especially James Ogondiek and the now retired and much beloved Thomas Msuka, 
both of whom recognized early on the value of this project 
and advocated for us to undertake the work required to develop 
and spread the ideas in this book.

Most of all, we are grateful to our students, 
for it is their curiosity and enthusiasm that has motivated everything.\\[24pt]
