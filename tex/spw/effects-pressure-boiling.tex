\chapter{Effects of Pressure on the Boiling Point}

\section{Aim}
To determine the effect of pressure on the boiling point of a substance

\section{Background Information}
All objects will boil at some temperature which is known as the boiling point. Typically, we think the boiling point occurs at a constant temperature of a body. For example, water boils at $100^\circ$C. However, someone boiling water in Dar es Salaam will find it happens at a different temperature than someone boiling water in Iringa. Why? 

\section{Materials}
Round bottomed flask, thermometer, cork, L-shaped glass tube, rubber tube, source of heat, water, clip, retort stand, wire gauze and tripled stand

\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Insert a thermometer and an L-shaped tube into the two holes of the cork.  
\item Attach a rubber tube to the end of the glass tube.
\item Half-fill a round bottomed flask with water.
\item Insert the cork into the mouth of the flask.
\item Clamp the round bottomed flask on a retort stand over a source of heat. 
\item Heat the water until it boils, record the temperature. 
\item Remove the source of heat and clip the rubber tube immediately.
\item Wait until the water stops boiling and then invert the flask on the retort stand.
\item Pour cold water over the flask, then observe the water and record the reading on the thermometer. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Analysis and Interpretation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compare the temperature before and after pouring the water over the flask.
\item What happened to the water in the flask when cold water was running over the flask?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
From the experiment, how does the pressure affect the boiling point of a substance?

\section{Questions for Discussion}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What was the purpose of pouring the cold water over the flask?
\item Why does it take a longer timer to cook beans on a high mountain rather than at the bottom?
\item Why is the boiling point of water higher in Dar than in Iringa?
\item What was the purpose of clipping the rubber tube?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reflection and Self Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How can you use the results of this experiment to cook beans more quickly?
\item Is there anything you do not understand in this experiment? If so, what is it and in what ways can you improve your understanding?
