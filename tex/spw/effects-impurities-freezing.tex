\chapter{Effects of Impurities on the Freezing Point}

\section{Aim}
To examine how salt impurities affect the freezing point of water

\section{Background Information}
Impurities are foreign substances within a pure substance. For example, pure water should have nothing in it except water molecules, but in natural water other substances such as salts, small particles of solid matter, and even dissolved gases can often be found. If impurities are present within a substance it is possible the mixture has a different freezing point than the pure substance. Therefore, there is a need to determine the relationship between the freezing point of water and the presence of salt impurities.

\section{Materials}
Stop watch, Beaker (250 mL), salt, ice, 2 thermometers

\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Record the room temperature using a thermometer.
\item Fill two medium size beakers with small pieces of ice and place a thermometer in each. 
\item Place the beakers apart from each other on a table, read and record their respective initial temperatures.
\item Put 100 g of salt into one of the beakers.
\item Observe and record the time and temperature at which the ice melts.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Analysis and Interpretation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What was the temperature of each beaker during the melting process? 
\item What was the temperature of the room during the melting process?
\item In which beaker did the ice melt faster?  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
How does the presence of salt impurities in water affect the waterâ€™s freezing point?

\section{Questions for Discussion}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do you think impurities always have the same effect on the freezing point of other substances? 
\item What are sources of error in this experiment? How might they affect your results?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reflection and Self Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How might the results of this experiment relate with the presence of impurities on the boiling point of a substance?
\item How could you use these results to keep roads safe in places which have snowed?
\end{enumerate}
