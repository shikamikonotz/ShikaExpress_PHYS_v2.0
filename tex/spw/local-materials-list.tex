\chapter{Local Materials List}

Where conventional materials cannot be acquired to perform a particular experiment, the following listed materials, which should be readily available at the village or nearby town, could be used. These materials can safely substitute the conventional materials without fear of losing accuracy or understanding. Imagination and innovativeness is encouraged on the part of the student and teacher to find other suitable local substitutions.  

\section{Archimedes' Principle}
Eureka can, beaker, measuring cylinder $\rightarrow$ plastic bottles\\
Retort stand $\rightarrow$ long stick fixed at a point

\section{Law Of Floatation}
Eureka can, beaker, measuring cylinder $\rightarrow$ plastic bottles\\
